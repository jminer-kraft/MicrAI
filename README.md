A simple AI written completely in HTML and JavaScript I have been working on since high school. I would like to continue it's development with other people.
	The way it works is it first asks if you would like to exit the programming mode, and if you put any derivative of "no" then it asks for 2 numbers then gives you an output
based on what you have answered previously.
If the answer you gave it is incorrect, then you enter the correct answer, and if it is correct then you put in whatever answer it gave you previously.
It will then repeat itself, and if you tell it to exit programming mode, then it will dump the data to the HTML file that called it, and make it visible to the user
(For Testing purposes).
It is supposed to be a module that can be added to any website, just add an interface and a system to do things with the answers that it returns.
